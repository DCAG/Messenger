# Messenger web client

The client was built using React and Socket.io.
the client was designed in mobile first approach and is responsive to screen size change. Built with **SASS** without bootstrap or any third party styling package.

first time run: `npm install`
during development or testing can be run with `npm run dev` or `vite`
for production run `vite build` so the matching environment variables will be loaded before deploying to production server or static web host
